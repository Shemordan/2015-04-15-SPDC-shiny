# shiny layout templates can be found here:
## Basic layouts: http://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/layout-guide.html
## More advanced layouts using shinydashboard: http://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/index.html

# this example uses the simpliest sidebar layout

# to specify the UI part of the app we need to call the shinyUI function
# this creates a Shiny UI handler

# on the server side we only need a shinyServer call that takes a function

# shinyUI(ui)
# ui    A user interace definition
shinyUI(
    # within the shinyUI function the first parameter is the UI
    # we are using the fluidPage UI
    # fluid refers to a 'reactive' layout, 'reactive' in a web UI sense, not
    # reactive in the shiny variable sense
    fluidPage(
        # each part of the fluid page is a shiny function
        # each function is separated with a comma

        # give our app a title
        titlePanel("woo... shiny..."),

        # next lets give our app the simple sidebar layout
        # it has a pannel on the left (or right) side and results/plots as the main body of the page
        # the side pannel will contain all our interactive widgets
        # each part of the sidebar layout is separated by a comma
        sidebarLayout(
            position = "right",
            sidebarPanel("sidebar panel",
